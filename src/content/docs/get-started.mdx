description: A guide to install and set up MediaUI in your VRChat world.

import { FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Unity and VRChat world building is assumed. 

You will need:

- A VRChat SDK3 World project on Unity 2022.3.22f1 or later.
- A supported videoplayer prefab (or the ability to modify scripts to add support). 
    - [VizVid](https://github.com/JLChnToZ/VVMW) is recommended.
    - [YAMAPlayer](https://github.com/koorimizuw/YamaPlayer), [ProTV](https://protv.dev/), and USharpVideo are also supported out of the box.

## Download the MediaUI Package

Download the latest version of the MediaUI package (v0.6.1) and import it into Unity ([tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZYJ7idfeuZQ)).

##### [Download Link](/dl/MediaUI%20v0.6.1.unitypackage) 

(A VRChat Package Repository & repository on GitHub will be available in the future for easier updates and transparency.)

## Setting Up MediaUI in Your VRChat World

Once you have imported the package, you should be able to see the MediaUI folder and prefab.

<FileTree>

- Assets/
  - MediaUI
    - Scripts/
    - UI&nbsp;Assets/
    - **MediaUI.prefab**
  - ...
- Packages/

</FileTree>

Drag and drop the **MediaUI.prefab** into your scene hierarchy and position it however you want.

Open the MediaUI GameObject in the hierarchy and select the **NyaResultsManager** object underneath it.

From here, instructions depend on your chosen videoplayer prefab.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="VizVid">
    Drag these two objects from your vidvid prefab into the respective fields in the NyaResultsManager component, as shown in this picture

    Depending on your prefab, it can also look more similar to this

    If you're unsure which objects to use, the `Video Player UI Controller` object should be the one with the VizVid **UI Handler** script, and the `Url Input Field` should be the one referenced in that script.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ProTV3">
      Drag these two objects from your ProTV3 prefab into the respective fields in the NyaResultsManager component, as shown in this picture

    ![Unity Hierarchy with annotation](../../assets/explorer_FlGe6ZxNSh.png)

    If you're unsure which objects to use, the `Video Player UI Controller` object should be the one with the ProTV3 **Media Controls** script, and the `Url Input Field` should be the one referenced in that script under `Main Url Input`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ProTV2">
      This prefab is supported, but docs have not been written yet. It *should* be similar to the ProTV3 setup.
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="YAMAPlayer">
      This prefab is supported, but docs have not been written yet. It *should* be similar to the other setups.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="USharpVideo">
      This prefab is supported, but docs have not been written yet. It *should* be similar to the other setups.
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Done!

You should now be able to build and test your world and play media from any of the [supported APIs](/apis) using MediaUI!
